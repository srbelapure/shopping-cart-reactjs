This commit done today(01/10/2020) includes following points

working:
1] login modal
2] 3 categories of products
3] can add producta to cart [also can be posted to server]
4] After finalizing the order it can be checked out

TODO:
1] css changes throught the application to be added
2] An issue is seen: When an item is added to cart, then it is not immediately reflected in the cart
{solution is: close the cart and click on open cart button to see updated list}
{possible fix is to call the fetch list api call in a suitable method of life cycle}
